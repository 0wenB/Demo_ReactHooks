useEffect: set a side effect when something else happen.

useEffect(setup, dependencies?)

setup is the function (logic/effect that we want)
dependencies are the thing which will trigger the setup function

4 cases of useEffect:
1) No dependency passed
2) An empty array as dependency
3) Props/state values as dependency
4) Effect Cleanup
